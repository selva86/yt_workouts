    "    This function loads our FAQ data. Think of it as our knowledge base.\n",
    "    We have 20 questions and answers on F1 Racing that our system will search through.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    faq_content = \"\"\"Question 1: What does F1 stand for in Formula 1 racing?\n",
    "    Answer 1: Formula One refers to the specific set of rules and regulations that all participating cars must follow, making it the highest class of single-seater auto racing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 2: How many teams compete in a typical F1 season?\n",
    "    Answer 2: Usually 10 teams, with each team fielding two cars, making a total of 20 drivers on the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 3: What is the significance of tire compounds in F1?\n",
    "    Answer 3: Different tire compounds offer varying levels of grip and durability, with softer compounds providing more grip but wearing out faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 4: How long is a standard F1 race distance?\n",
    "    Answer 4: Races are typically around 305 kilometers (190 miles), except Monaco which is shorter at 260 kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 5: What is DRS and when can drivers use it?\n",
    "    Answer 5: Drag Reduction System - a moveable rear wing element that reduces drag. Drivers can activate it in designated zones when within one second of the car ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 6: What determines the starting grid positions for a race?\n",
    "    Answer 6: Qualifying sessions where drivers compete in three knockout rounds (Q1, Q2, Q3) to determine their starting positions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Question 7: How many points are awarded for winning an F1 race?\n",
    "    Answer 7: 25 points for the winner, with decreasing points down to 1 point for 10th place, plus an additional point for the fastest lap.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 8: What is the purpose of the pit stop in F1?\n",
    "    Answer 8: To change tires, refuel (in past eras), make repairs, or adjust the car's setup during the race.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 9: What is understeer and oversteer in F1 driving?\n",
    "    Answer 9: Understeer occurs when the front wheels lose grip and the car doesn't turn enough; oversteer happens when the rear loses grip and the car turns too much.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 10: How do F1 cars generate downforce?\n",
    "    Answer 10: Through aerodynamic elements like wings, diffusers, and the car's floor design that create low pressure under the car, pulling it toward the track.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 11: What is the role of the F1 Safety Car?\n",
    "    Answer 11: To slow down the field during dangerous conditions, allowing marshals to clear incidents safely while maintaining the race order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 12: How much do F1 cars weigh?Answer 12: The minimum weight including the driver is 798 kg (1,759 lbs), though teams often add ballast to reach this minimum for better weight distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 13: What is parc fermé in F1?\n",
    "    Answer 13: A period from qualifying to the race start where teams cannot make significant setup changes to their cars.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 14: How fast can F1 cars accelerate?\n",
    "    Answer 14: They can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in approximately 2.4 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 15: What is the difference between wet and intermediate tires?\n",
    "    Answer 15: Intermediate tires are for damp conditions with standing water, while full wet tires are designed for heavy rain with deeper treads.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 16: Who governs F1 racing?\n",
    "    Answer 16: The FIA (Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile) sets the rules and regulations for Formula 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 17: What is the halo device on F1 cars?\n",
    "    Answer 17: A titanium safety structure above the cockpit designed to protect drivers' heads from debris and impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 18: How are F1 engines different from road car engines?\n",
    "    Answer 18: F1 engines are highly sophisticated hybrid power units with turbocharging, energy recovery systems, and can rev up to 15,000 RPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 19: What is slipstreaming in F1?\n",
    "    Answer 19: Following closely behind another car to benefit from reduced air resistance, allowing for higher speeds and potential overtaking opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Question 20: How does the championship points system work?\n",
    "    Answer 20: Drivers and constructors accumulate points throughout the season based on race finishes, with the highest point totals winning their respective championships.\n",
